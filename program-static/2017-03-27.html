The sparse matrix-vector multiply (SpMV) is a key component in the solve phase of algebraic multigrid (AMG).  The coarse levels of AMG hierarchies often require a large number of small messages to be communicated during each SpMV, yielding large communication costs on levels near the middle of the hierarchy.  Furthermore, as linear systems are solved on increasingly large parallel systems, communication among processes dominates the cost of each SpMV.  Topology-aware methods, which can map an MPI rank to a physical node, can be used to reduce the costs associated with communication.  Values can be redistributed among all processes local to a node before being communicated across the network, reducing the inter-node communication requirements at the cost of additional, less-costly, intra-node communication.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">08:25</td><td><a name="talk:37046"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person29.html">Elena Agostini</a></div></a><div class="title">OPTIMIZING COMMUNICATIONS IN MULTI-GRID METHODS USING GPUDIRECT ASYNC</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a class="person" href="person29.html">Elena Agostini</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. HPGMG is a benchmark for HPC geometric multi-grid methods. A multi-grid solver works on a grid having a fixed total size but different resolutions during the execution so that the amount of computation and communication varies significantly within the same application. NVIDIA developed a CUDA version of HPGMG-FV (Finite Volume) where, according to a threshold, finer (higher) levels are computed on the GPU whereas coarser (lower) levels on the CPU: that hybrid  scheme exploits at their best the strengths of both platforms. During the HPGMG-FV execution, there are three main communication phases: boundaries exchange (among a variable number of cluster nodes), interpolation (lower to higher level) and restriction (higher to lower level). By default communications use the Message Passing Interface (MPI). GPUDirect Async is a new technology introduced by NVIDIA in CUDA 8.0 to support mutual direct control between the GPU and the interconnect device, a Mellanox Infiniband HCA in our case. In this paper, we propose two optimized communication schemes involving the GPUDirect Async technology, where the burden of the communication is off-loaded onto the GPU itself. When running a properly modified version of HPGMG-FV, where Async technology is used for only those aforementioned communication phases, the communication overhead reduces up to 26%.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">08:50</td><td><a name="talk:37037"><div class="authors"><a href="person51.html" class="person">Wayne Mitchell</a> and <a href="person13.html" class="person">Tom Manteuffel</a></div></a><div class="title">Studying Convergence of Nested Iteration with Range Decomposition</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a class="person" href="person51.html">Wayne Mitchell</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT.

In recent years, large heterogeneous systems have grown in importance for solving all kinds of problems. While most implementations make use of parallelisation only on a CPU-level, our approach is to develop an efficient hybrid version, incorporating both multiple CPUs and multiple GPUs simultaneously. This allows us to make use of all resources available in modern supercomputers. Overcoming slow communication between the host (CPU) and the device (GPU) is the key to achieve increased performance. In this talk, we discuss various designs as to how a domain can be partitioned for both CPUs and GPUs, and their benefits and shortcomings. Following this, we'll pick one of the designs and look at some performance benchmarks, comparing our hybrid to a CPUs-only version. Finally, we'll take a look at potential benefits of this approach to multigrid.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">09:40</td><td><a name="talk:37026"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person19.html">Ulrich Ruede</a></div></a><div class="title">Finite Element Based Multigrid at Scale </div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a class="person" href="person19.html">Ulrich Ruede</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. Multigrid methods promise to solve PDE at the cost of a few work units,
where a work unit is defined as the cost of executing a relaxation of the
discrete system. 
Following the classical notion of Brandt, textbook efficiency
is achieved when the number of work units for computing a solution remains below ten.
It has been shown that textbook efficiency
can be achieved for many essential problems, such as, e.g., scalar elliptic PDE or
Stokes-like saddle point systems. </p>
<p>Assuming in turn that a work unit costs about 100
Floating Point operations, the ideal cost for solving a discretized PDE is below 1000 Floating point operations per degree of freedom. Given that a supercomputer may perform at a 
 PetaFlops, i.e.~can execute 10^15 floating point operations per second, we
expect to solve well-behaved PDE at a rate of  a trillion (i.e. 10^12) degrees of freedom per second.
A ''tiny'' problem, with say a billion (10^9) unknowns should then be solved in a millisecond.</p>
<p>This idealistic prediction cannot be reached.
However, it is troublesome to realize that many existing solvers do not only underperform
by a moderate factor, but that they fail to reach this performance by factors of three to six orders of magnitude.
Such a discrepancy between theoretical knowledge and computational practice cannot be explained by the arguments that appear in the literature, such
as communication overhead, the need to optimize the code, 
or by blaming it on unfavorable memory-hierarchy effects. 
The reasons for our failure to predict performance from the fundamental mathematical
properties of the algorithm  are deeper and are caused 
by fundamental problems in how we design, analyze, implement,
and test numerical methods. The talk will try to shed some light on this situation. 
As a test bed we will use the Hierarchical Hybrid Grids (HHG) multigrid prototyping software
that can solve up to $10^{13}$ degrees of freedom for problems.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session"><div class="coffeebreak"><span class="interval">10:05-10:25</span><span class="title">Coffee and Tea Break</span></div></div><div class="session"><a name="session:13350"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">10:25-12:30</span> <span class="title">Session 5: Performance Modeling - In honor of Hormozd Gahvari</span></div></a><div class="session_chair"><div class="chair_word">Chair: </div><div class="chair_names"><a class="person" href="person22.html">Ulrike Yang</a></div></div><div class="room"><span class="room_word">Location: </span><span class="room_name">Bighorn C</span></div><table class="talks"><tr class="talk"><td class="time">10:25</td><td><a name="talk:37027"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person73.html">Hormozd Gahvari</a>, <a href="person22.html" class="person">Ulrike Yang</a>, <a href="person74.html" class="person">Veselin Dobrev</a>, <a href="person9.html" class="person">Rob Falgout</a>, <a href="person75.html" class="person">Tzanio Kolev</a>, <a href="person76.html" class="person">Jacob Schroder</a> and <a href="person77.html" class="person">Martin Schulz</a></div></a><div class="title">A Performance Model for Allocating the Parallelism in a Multigrid-in-Time Solver</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a class="person" href="person22.html">Ulrike Yang</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. The traditional way to numerically solve time dependent problems is to sequentially march through time, solving for one time step and then the next. The parallelism in this approach is limited to the spatial dimension, which is quickly exhausted, causing the gain from using more processors to solve a problem to diminish. One approach to overcome this barrier is to use methods that are parallel in time. These methods have the potential to achieve dramatically better performance compared to time-stepping approaches, but achieving this performance requires carefully choosing the amount of parallelism devoted to space versus the amount devoted to time. Here, we present a performance model that, for a multigrid-in-time solver, makes the decision on when to switch to parallel-in-time and on how much parallelism to devote to space vs. time. In our experiments, the model selects the best parallel conﬁguration in most of our test cases and a conﬁguration close to the best one in all other cases.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">10:50</td><td><a name="talk:36982"><div class="authors"><a href="person170.html" class="person">Hormozd Gahvari</a>, <a class="person" href="person171.html">Martin Schulz</a>, <a href="person22.html" class="person">Ulrike Meier Yang</a>, <a href="person25.html" class="person">William Gropp</a> and <a href="person11.html" class="person">Kirk E.

This talk considers situations where it is may be problematic to directly apply algebraic multigrid (AMG) to the matrix system that one is interested in solving. In these cases, one can instead consider applying AMG to a distance Laplacian matrix in order to generate grid transfer operators within the multigrid hierarchy. The resulting hierarchy is then post-processed by taking the original matrix of interest and projecting it on all levels using the grid transfers obtained with the distance Laplacian.  This distance Laplacian matrix, L, has the same sparsity pattern as the original matrix for scalar PDE systems.  Off diagonal entries, L_{ij} correspond to the negative reciprocal of the distance between the i and j mesh nodes while diagonal entries are chosen so that the sum of the entries within each matrix row is zero.</p>
<p>Two examples will be given where a distance Laplacian strategy is adapted to a specific context. The first example corresponds to single phase porous media flow (reservoir modeling). In this case, the underlying mesh is highly stretched and the equations include large permeability variations. Additionally, the discretization scheme is such that there are multiple degrees-of-freedom (dofs) at some grid nodes (coming from opposite sides of a crack). Depending on the permeability of the crack, these opposite-side dofs might be strongly coupled or weakly coupled.  The second example comes from a multiphase flow formulation that allows for discontinuous pressures at interfaces. In this case, a distance Laplacian/AMG approach is used to avoid complications associated with applying AMG to system where the the number of PDE equations per node varies.  In both cases, adaption of the distance Laplacian idea is necessary to successfully address difficulties associated with the specifics of each application.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">16:55</td><td><a name="talk:37007"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person131.html">Ben Southworth</a>, <a href="person13.html" class="person">Tom Manteuffel</a>, <a class="person" href="person132.html">John Ruge</a> and <a href="person133.html" class="person">Steffen Muenzenmaier</a></div></a><div class="title">Reduction-based Algebraic Multigrid for Upwind Discretizations</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a class="person" href="person131.html">Ben Southworth</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is a powerful solver for certain classes of large, sparse linear systems, Ax = b, often arising from the discretization of PDEs. However, convergence theory and most variations of AMG rely on A being symmetric positive definite. Here, a new reduction-based AMG method is developed for upwind discretizations of hyperbolic PDEs. Theory is presented motivating the reduction approach, and connecting it in a big-picture sense to other non-symmetric AMG methods. Two variations are introduced, a scalar algorithm, as well as a block-wise approach targeting higher-order discretizations.

In this talk, we will present an approach to compute interpolation coefficients in algebraic multigrid (AMG) that can integrate additional test vectors that span the near null space of the global matrix. The presented approach is based on the framework of AMGe, which computes the interpolation coefficients by solving local quadratic minimization problems. The local operators are computed algebraically by defining local extension mappings as done in the element-free AMGe work. So, this work is a natural extension to element-free AMGe to be able to handle an arbitrary number of test vectors. The connections between the direct and indirect interpolation schemes within the proposed approach and the connections to the standard AMG methods will be discussed.

Algebraic multigrid methods have proven to be reliable and efficient methods for the solution of large sparse linear systems of equations in many different application areas and their theoretical foundation has been studied extensively. Though, there remains a mismatch between practical implementations and theory. On one hand many algebraic multigrid constructions successfully used in practice do not allow for a precise theoretical analysis. And on the other hand there is abstract theory, which at least in the two-grid case, gives exact predictions of the convergence rate, but does not hint at the proper construction of the constituents of the method. In this talk we try to bridge this gap between theory and practice.</p>
<p>In this talk we derive, based on the exact two-grid theory, an optimal interpolation operator for two-grid algebraic multigrid methods. We show that it matches the exact convergence rate of the theory and is in agreement with the limiting cases of the theory, namely when the two-grid method becomes an exact solve. As a side-product we obtain a relation between the convergence rate of the optimal two-grid method and the dimension of the coarse-grid space. Equipped with the information on its dimension, we develop a method that locates representatives of the coarse-grid degrees of freedom that allow for a sparse approximation of the optimal interpolation operator. This analysis thus indicates if a practical method, which prescribes the sparsity of interpolation can achieve a near-optimal convergence rate.</p>
<p>While the optimal interpolation is an interesting theoretical tool, which reveals a lot of information about the problem and the constituents of the two-grid method, its direct practical use is limited. Thus we finish the talk by presenting ideas on how to integrate the concept of optimal interpolation into the Bootstrap algebraic multigrid framework and present numerical results for a variety of applications.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">18:10</td><td><a name="talk:37021"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person86.html">Naoya Nomura</a>, <a href="person87.html" class="person">Akihiro Fujii</a>, <a class="person" href="person88.html">Teruo Tanaka</a>, <a class="person" href="person89.html">Kengo Nakajima</a> and <a class="person" href="person90.html">Osni Marques</a></div></a><div class="title">Performance Analysis of SA-AMG Solver with Additional Near-Kernel Vectors at Coarser Levels</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a href="person86.html" class="person">Naoya Nomura</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. The smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid (SA-AMG) method is among the fastest solvers for large-scale linear equations. The SA-AMG method achieves good convergence by generating small-sized matrices from the original matrix problem. However, the convergence of the method can be further improved by setting near-kernel vectors. There are related works on how to set near-kernel vectors adequately, including adaptive smoothed aggregation multigrid. Almost all of the related works uses the same number of near-kernel vectors at all levels. In our research, we evaluate the method of adding additional multiple near-kernel vectors at coarser levels. We have implemented the solver that extracts near-kernel vectors and add them at the fine level and one coarser level. The solver can use different number of near kernel vectors at each level. Especially when the coarser levels' smoother convergence property influence the convergence of the whole solver, this method has possibility to improve the convergence using additional near-kernel vectors at coarser levels. This research investigates the balance between the increasing cost of the coarser levels and the improvement of the convergence by using multiple near-kernel vectors at the coarser levels.</p></div></td></tr></table></div></div>
