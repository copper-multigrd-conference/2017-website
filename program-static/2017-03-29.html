In this paper, we present a novel isogeometric multigrid approach to the numerical solution of the classical Navier-Stokes equations. This formulation utilizes divergence-conforming B-spline basis functions which respect the underlying de Rham cohomology, in particular, the relationship between the pressure and velocity variables through differential operators. Schwarz-style smoothers in conjunction with overlapping subdomains respecting this de Rham sequence are employed for use in a geometric multigrid method. Numerical results for Darcy-Stokes and generalized Oseen flows, arising through explicit and semi-implicit Navier-Stokes discretizations, are presented in both two- and three-dimensions.

Since the Nobel prize has been awarded in 2010 for the
isolation of graphene, research on this miraculous 2-dimensional
material has flourished. In order to calculate the electronic properties
of graphene structures a tight-binding approach can be used. The
tight-binding formulation leads to linear systems of equations which are
maximally indefinite and can be seen both as a discretization of a
system of PDEs or a staggered discretization. In this talk we present a
geometric multigrid method for this problem and the results of the
two-level convergence analysis obtained by local Fourier analysis.
Numerical tests show the exactness of the local Fourier analysis and the scalability of the multigrid method.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">08:50</td><td><a name="talk:37031"><div class="authors"><a href="person61.html" class="person">Nathan V.

The discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) methodology of Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan guarantees the optimality of the solution in an energy norm, and provides several features facilitating adaptive schemes. A key question that has not yet been answered in general—though there are some results for Poisson, e.g.—is how best to precondition the DPG system matrix, so that iterative solvers may be used to allow solution of large-scale problems.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we detail a strategy for preconditioning the DPG system matrix using geometric multigrid, which we have implemented as part of the Camellia finite element library, and demonstrate through numerical experiments its effectiveness in the context of several variational formulations. We observe that in some of our experiments, the behavior of the preconditioner is closely tied to the discrete test space enrichment.</p>
<p>We include experiments involving adaptive meshes with hanging nodes for lid-driven cavity flow, demonstrating that the preconditioners can be applied in the context of challenging problems.

We use cell-centered finite difference discretizations and we develop a GMG solver for the resulting linear systems, which are non-symmetric and may be highly ill-conditioned. With pure, homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, the equation corresponding to the zero harmonic becomes singular Poisson. In that case, we propose using TQRCP or TSVD as the coarse-grid solver.

Problems from graph drawing, spectral clustering, network flow and graph partitioning all can be expressed as Laplacian matrices. Theoretically fast approaches to solving these problems exist, but in practice these techniques are slow. Three practical approaches have been proposed and work well in serial. However, as problem sizes increase and single core speeds stagnate, parallelism is essential to solve problems quickly. We present an unsmoothed aggregation Multigrid method for solving graph Laplacians in distributed memory setting. Our solver scales up to 64 compute nodes and achieves speedups of up to 83x over the existing serial solutions.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">08:25</td><td><a name="talk:36981"><div class="authors"><a href="person172.html" class="person">Eric Mjolsness</a> and <a class="person" href="person173.html">Cory Scott</a></div></a><div class="title">An algebraic multigrid approach to scalable graphs for multiscale modeling</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a href="person172.html" class="person">Eric Mjolsness</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. Many computational models in science and in machine learning respect locality defined on graphs that may be more general than conventional meshes. If we could define a useful distance-like measure between graphs, we could for example use graph grammars to define the structure of exponentially-growing sequences of graphs (we call them graph lineages) that are relatively close to each other in that distance measure, and relatively far from graphs in other such sequences, and we could use these relationships to study the scaling of scientific models. To this end we theoretically and computationally investigate inter-graph distance-like measures that are defined in terms of prolongation/restriction matrices that optimally match the effects of diffusion processes within the two graphs. We suggest that these prolongation/restriction matrices may be derived while computing graph-graph distance and then used to relate successive graphs in a graph lineage, and thereby to define multiscale dynamical models. In a second portion of this work we assume several graph lineages (defined by graph grammars) are each well controlled in this manner, and define efficient lineage-level operations that can produce new graph lineages from old ones, such as a “skeletal product” which is much more space-efficient (particularly for high-dimensional problems) than conventional graph products. We measure critical indices of Ising models on skeletal product graphs.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">08:50</td><td><a name="talk:36991"><div class="authors"><a href="person159.html" class="person">Colin Ponce</a> and <a class="person" href="person85.html">Panayot Vassilevski</a></div></a><div class="title">Solving Graph Laplacian Systems Through Recursive Partitioning and Two-Grid Preconditioning</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a href="person159.html" class="person">Colin Ponce</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. We present a parallelizable direct method for computing the solution
to graph Laplacian-based linear systems derived from graphs that can
be hierarchically bipartitioned with small edge cuts.  For a graph
of size n that can be recursively partitioned into equal-sized
sets with constant-size edge cuts, our method decomposes a graph
Laplacian in time O(n log n), and then uses that decomposition to
perform a linear solve in time O(n \log n).</p>
<p>Many real-world graphs, however, do not possess this property. So, we
use this technique to design a preconditioner for graph Laplacians
that do not have this property. Finally, we augment this
preconditioner with a two-grid method that accounts for much of the
preconditioner's weaknesses. We present an analysis of this method, as
well as a general theorem for the condition number of a general class
of two-grid support graph-based preconditioners. Numerical experiments

Negative weights lead to possible negative spectrum of the standard graph Laplacian, which is cured by defining a signed Laplacian.

As the number of cores increases on current and future architectures, the natural sequential approach to time integration is becoming a more serious bottleneck for achieving high scalability. One alternative to overcome this problem is the use of multigrid-in-time algorithms such as MGRIT [1]. Although first designed for one-step methods, we apply the MGRIT algorithm to multistep BDF methods for the integration of fully implicit non linear Differential Algebraic Equations (DAE) using adaptive refinement in time. The DAEs presented here arise from power system simulations, for which variable step-size methods are useful to deal with discontinuities. Another approach using root-finding capabilities is investigated.

Fractional calculus has become increasingly popular in recent years due to their frequent appearance in various applications. Due to the nonlocal property of fractional differential operators, numerical methods usually generate systems of equations where the coefficient matrix is dense. The standard solution of such systems requires a very high computational cost in addition to a high storage cost. This is quite different from the integer differential operators, which typically yield sparse coefficient matrices that can be efficiently solved by fast iterative methods with $O(N)$ complexity, being $N$ the number of grid points. Therefore, the design of efficient solvers for the numerical simulation of these problems is a difficult task. In this work, we propose a parallel-in-time algorithm based on the waveform relaxation approach, whose application to time-fractional problems seems very natural. This is due to the fact that the fractional derivative at each spatial point depends on the values of the function at this point at all earlier times.
Exploiting the Toeplitz-like structure of the coefficient matrix, the computational complexity of the proposed multigrid waveform relaxation method is $O(N M \log(M))$, where $M$ is the number of time steps and $N$ is the number of spatial grid points. Moreover, a semi-algebraic mode analysis is used to theoretically confirm the good results obtained.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">11:15</td><td><a name="talk:37047"><div class="authors"><a href="person27.html" class="person">Olaf Steinbach</a> and <a class="person" href="person28.html">Huidong Yang</a></div></a><div class="title">Algebraic multigrid methods for an adaptive  space-time finite element discretization</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a class="person" href="person28.html">Huidong Yang</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT.

Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) phenomena are present in many different fields of application, such as biomedical engineering. Even with simplistic mathematical models, numerical simulations of a studied time-dependent system may yield significant computational cost. For example, simulating periodic FSI problems usually requires running multiple cycles to achieve periodic steady-state. For real-world engineering problems, the time-to-solution may often be undesirably large and conflict with required fast turn-around. Thus, parallelization techniques are the key to decrease the wall clock time of a given algorithm.</p>
<p>Spatial parallelization techniques, such as domain decomposition methods, are commonly used to speed up computations by distributing the work load per time step amongst a number of available processors. However, spatial parallelization saturates with increasing communication tasks and an optimum number of processors (for example, with respect to parallel efficiency or minimum runtime) may not fully utilize the available resources. A further reduction of the time-to-solution may be achieved by, for example, parallelization in the temporal domain.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will present a multigrid-reduction-in-time (MGRIT) algorithm [1] for the solution of a time-dependent and generally nonlinear system. The MGRIT algorithm is a true multilevel approach based on multigrid techniques applied to the temporal domain and thus introduces a grid hierarchy of fine and coarse time grids. It solves the global space-time problem iteratively by employing multigrid cycling (e.g. V- and F-cycles), FC relaxation and coarse-grid updates. The algorithm uses multiple temporal levels and allows re-use of optimized and efficient solvers. Further, temporal parallelization may be complemented with spatial parallelization to solve the spatial problem for each time point more effectively. The MGRIT algorithm provides a non-intrusive way to achieve speedups beyond the speedups that are observed for purely space-parallel methods.</p>
<p>To provide a thorough basis for further investigations of multi-physics problems, we study the application of the MGRIT algorithm to single-physics problems, such as flow over a moving domain. Here, we focus on properties of the space-time solver (e.g. scalability) and demonstrate that traditional time stepping schemes (i.e. direct temporal solvers) and the MGRIT solver (i.e. iterative temporal solver) solve the same system of equations. We further extend this approach in the context of FSI, demonstrating efficacy using FSI benchmark problems.</p>

Multigrid methods have been developed for both structured and unstructured grids. In terms of exascale computing, memory, and setup time, there are significant potential advantages to structured mesh approaches over unstructured schemes. Further, multigrid algorithms that take advantage of structure can exhibit superior convergence rates when compared with their unstructured multigrid counterparts. Unfortunately, the types of applications that can be addressed with structured meshes are quite limited. In many circumstances, however, an application may only require complex unstructured meshes within small sub-regions of the overall domain to accurately capture important physical features.

Computer simulations of multiphysics problems not only grow in size but
also in complexity including more and more types of physics and coupling

temporal and spatial mechanisms often demand implicit time integration
and the solution of large coupled linear systems represented by blocked
operators.</p>
<p>While multigrid methods are known to be efficient for certain classes of
single-field problems, the design and handling of fully coupled
physics-based multigrid preconditioners for multiphysics problems
remains a challenge. MueLu is a multigrid framework in Trilinos which
allows one to flexibly build and extend application-specific block
preconditioners based on aggregation-based algebraic multigrid methods.
It can be used in combination with the existing block preconditioning
package Teko from Trilinos in a very flexible way: MueLu either provides
the multigrid capability used within Teko block preconditioners, or MueLu
can use the Teko implementation of block preconditioners as block smoothers
within its multiphysics multigrid preconditioners.</p>
<p>Furthermore, MueLu allows the definition of simple user interfaces with a minimum
of user parameters for application-specific multiphysics preconditioners.
This helps end users to apply the preconditioners in a production environment
without suffering from the complexity of modern physics-based blocked multigrid
preconditioners.</p>

The Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) is a parallel finite element, multiphysics framework, which has the capability to simulate fully  coupled multiphysics from a wide range of physical processes including fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, phase field fracture, and neutronics. Fully coupled multiphysics present unique numerical challenges due to the large number of disparate properties involved on different time and spatial scales. To overcome this difficulty, we present a class of parallel hybrid algorithms based on field-splitting, algebraic multigrid (AMG) and additive Schwarz methods (ASM). Field-splitting, AMG and ASM have been individually explored thoroughly but the use of them in combination for coupled multiphysics has not fully realized. We design and implement a class of  parallel hybrid algorithms in MOOSE  to explore optimal combinations of field-splitting AMG and ASM for improving simulation efficiency. We show that these parallel hybrid algorithms are scalable and efficient for multiphysics problems in parallel.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session"><div class="lunchbreak"><span class="interval">12:30-16:00</span><span class="title">Lunch Break</span></div></div><div class="session"><div class="coffeebreak"><span class="interval">16:00-16:30</span><span class="title">Coffee and Tea Break</span></div></div><div class="session"><a name="session:13356"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">16:30-18:35</span> <span class="title">Session 13: Student Paper Competition</span></div></a><div class="session_chair"><div class="chair_word">Chair: </div><div class="chair_names"><a class="person" href="person16.html">Luke Olson</a></div></div><div class="room"><span class="room_word">Location: </span><span class="room_name">Bighorn C</span></div><table class="talks"><tr class="talk"><td class="time">16:30</td><td><a name="talk:37041"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person42.html">Peiyao Luo</a></div></a><div class="title">Monolithic Multigrid Method for the Coupled Stokes Flow and Deformable Porous Medium System</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a href="person42.html" class="person">Peiyao Luo</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. The interaction between fluid flow and a deformable porous medium is a complicated multi-physics problem which can be described by a coupled model based on the Stokes and poroelastic equations. A monolithic multigrid method together with a coupled Vanka smoother and a decoupled Uzawa smoother is employed as an efficient numerical technique for the linear discrete system obtained by finite volumes on staggered grids. A novelty in our modeling approach is that at the interface of the fluid and poroelastic medium, two unknowns from the different subsystems are defined at the same grid point. We propose a special discretization at or near the points in the interface, which combines the approximation of the governing equations and the considered interface conditions. In the decoupled Uzawa smoother, Local Fourier analysis (LFA) helps us to select optimal values of the relaxation parameter appearing. To implement the monolithic multigrid method, grid partitioning is used to deal with the interface updates when communications are required between two subdomains. Numerical experiments show that the proposed numerical method provides an excellent convergence. The efficiency and robustness of the method are confirmed in numerical experiments with typically small values of the physical coefficients.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">16:55</td><td><a name="talk:37038"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person50.html">Alexander Howse</a></div></a><div class="title">Multigrid Reduction in Time with Adaptive Spatial Coarsening for the Linear Advection Equation</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a class="person" href="person50.html">Alexander Howse</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. We apply a multigrid reduction in time algorithm to hyperbolic partial differential equations. This study is motivated by the observation that sequential time stepping is an obvious computational bottleneck when attempting to implement highly concurrent algorithms, thus parallel-in-time methods are particularly desirable. In the case of explicit time stepping, spatial coarsening may be necessary to ensure stability conditions are satisfied on all levels, and it may be useful for implicit time stepping by producing cheaper multigrid cycles. Unfortunately, classical spatial coarsening results in extremely slow convergence when the wave speed is near zero, even if only locally. We present an adaptive spatial coarsening strategy which addresses this issue for 1D linear advection and implicit time stepping. Numerical results show that this offers significant improvements over classical coarsening. Future improvements and extensions to explicit time stepping are discussed.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">17:20</td><td><a name="talk:37035"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person54.html">Alyson Fox</a></div></a><div class="title"> Algebraic Multigrid for Directed Graph Laplacian Linear Systems (NS-LAMG)</div><div class="speaker">SPEAKER: <a href="person54.html" class="person">Alyson Fox</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. Often real-world graphs are directed, meaning that information flows from a vertex to another vertex in one direction, such as hyperlink graphs, biological neural networks and electrical power grids. There are many applications where data scientists are interested in solving linear systems associated with directed graphs. Currently, data scientists are using preconditioned GMRES and LSQR to solve linear systems involving directed graph associated matrix representations (e.g. graph Laplacian). However, these methods tend to be unacceptably slow as the number of edges grows. We propose a new algebraic multigrid algorithm, Nonsymmetric Lean Algebraic Multigrid (NS-LAMG),  that uses ideas from undirected graph Laplacian multigrid solvers, nonsymmetric Smoothed Aggregation and Markov chain stationary probability vector multigrid solvers. We redefine low-degree elimination proposed in Lean Algebraic Multigrid for undirected graphs to directed graphs and numerically show that low-degree elimination increases NS-LAMG performance. We adapt the transfer operators from nonsymmetric Smoothed Aggregation by using the null-space vectors of the problem matrix and numerically show that NS-LAMG out performs GMRES(k) for real-world, directed graph Laplacian linear systems.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session notalk"><a name="session:13373"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">18:15-21:00</span> <span class="title">Session : Banquet with cash bar at Copper Conference Center</span></div></a><div class="room"><span class="room_word">Location: </span><span class="room_name">Copper Conference Center</span></div></div></div>
